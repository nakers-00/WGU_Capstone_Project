# This file is the hash table that will be used to store package info.
# Create hash table class with chaining. This hash table takes in package ID as the key and package objects as the
# value. Therefore, it holds all necessary data components in the package object and each are easily and efficiently
# accessible.
# This hash table has an average time complexity of O(1) and a worst-case of O(n). The space complexity is O(n).
